<h4>Industrial Station</h4>
<p>The industrial station is where all of your gear is produced for the conquest of the world. You will start out with a basic unit, Engine I which will produce some basic gear. You can upgrade your unit to a vast expanse of
    different units, that increase in power. You can build these units at the work station.
